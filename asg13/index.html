	 <p>This job seems to be a good job to get my feet wet in the industry. I feel like I could learn a lot from the people and workplace here.
     From what i see from the company, it feels like a fun mix of design and real hands-on work. I like the idea of seeing my designs actually turn 
	 into products at events. I think this job could help me grow my Illustrator skills and get more experience in the event/branding world longterm (hopefully :O).</p>

	 <p>I took a look over at UKG (Ultimate Kronos Group) because it feels like a workplace that is super structured and I know that at this place they 
	 must not mess around. I actually enjoy that though, the organization and chacking thinfs for quality, I feel like this job could teach me more about production,
	 shippping, and staying more effecient with certain skills.(Which is all skills i feel like I'll definetly use in the future when I want a better position.)</p>

	 <a href="https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=41fa8d1d1773cf8c&from=shareddesktop_copy">Job#3</a>	
	 <p>This job I feel like is a cute dream job of mine, I'd feel like the enviroment would be fun and I've always been interested in printmaking, since its a hobby of mine.
	 But I also want to work here because the role covers exactly the kind of design work I want to get better at. The fast-paced enviroment could help push me and help me grow as well.
	I feel like being a part of an in-house creative team would help me build stronger skills/habbits which would help me gain more experience and job opportunities.</p>
