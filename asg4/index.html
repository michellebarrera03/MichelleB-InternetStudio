	<h1>Assignment 4</h1>
	<h2>My Least Favorite Artist: Beyonce</h2>
	<p>I just feel like Beyoncé comes off as kind of schemy and shady sometimes. Like there’s always some hidden plan behind
		everything she does, and it doesn’t feel real or genuine to me. It makes it hard for me to connect with her music or
		see her as an honest artist.</p>
