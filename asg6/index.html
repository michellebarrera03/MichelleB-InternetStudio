    <h1>Six Thinking Hats</h1>

    <div class="column">
      <div class="hat-section white-hat">
        <h2>White Hat</h2>
        <p>The project idea is clear and well thought out, it focuses on giving digital artists a space to share their sticker designs and users a fun way to express themselves. Some details still need clarification, like how uploads work and whether stickers will be free or paid.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="hat-section red-hat">
        <h2>Red Hat</h2>
        <p>This idea feels really fun and fresh. It’s something I could actually see people using and enjoying, especially artists who want to share their work in a more personal way.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="column">
      <div class="hat-section black-hat">
        <h2>Black Hat</h2>
        <p>One concern is that there are already a lot of sticker platforms out there, so standing out could be tough. It’ll also take some planning to make sure the site runs smoothly and that artists’ work is protected from being copied or misused.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="hat-section yellow-hat">
        <h2>Yellow Hat</h2>
        <p>This project has a lot of potential because it gives artists a space to connect with people who love their style. It could also make texting more creative and fun, which would definitely appeal to a lot of users.</p>
      </div>

    <div class="column">
      <div class="hat-section green-hat">
        <h2>Green Hat</h2>
        <p>Try adding features like letting users mix and match stickers to make their own sets or even create animated ones. Find somehting that will seperate you from your competitors. Maybe make a section where the user can create their own sticker through an added feature.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="hat-section blue-hat">
        <h2>Blue Hat</h2>
        <p>The project idea is solid and has a clear purpose. At this stage, it might help to do more creative brainstorming (green hat thinking) to explore ways to stand out and keep users coming back.</p>

  <h2>Reflection Paragraph</h2>
  <p>After going through the Six Thinking Hats discussion, my project has become more refined and focused. I now have a clearer understanding of what details need to be developed, such as how artists will upload their stickers and whether the platform will include paid options. The feedback helped me see the importance of standing out from existing sticker platforms, so I plan to include more creative features like customizable sticker sets and artist spotlights to make the site unique. I also realized how important it is to build a safe, supportive space where artists feel their work is protected and appreciated. Overall, this discussion has given me stronger direction and new ideas to make the project more engaging and successful.</p>
