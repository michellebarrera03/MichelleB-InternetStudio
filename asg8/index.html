  <h1>Domain Name Ideas</h1>

  <h2>Possible Domain Names</h2>

    <li>mindmeltstudio.com</li>
    <li>artflowhub.com</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Discussion Summary</h2>
  <p>
    I talked with my classmate N.T about possible domain name ideas for my semester project.
    We looked at the Domain Naming slides and focused on how people often remember shorter,
    made-up names that have a nice sound to them. We also avoided long descriptive names that
    might be hard to remember or type. We both liked the idea of using names that felt creative,
    catchy, and connected to the type of work I’ll be showing on my site.
  </p>

  <p>
    Out of the three ideas, the domain name <strong>stikidesign.com</strong> stood out to me the most.
    I like it because it’s short, fun to say, and has a unique ring to it — it sounds memorable and
    reflects the simple, creative tone I want my website to have. The name “Stiki” also ties in well
    with the idea of something that “sticks” with people, which is exactly what I hope my work does.
