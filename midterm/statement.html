                    My goal for this project was to create a design that captures the heart of Sumikko Gurashi — soft, friendly, and comforting. I leaned into visuals that felt playful and round, keeping everything approachable and calm. The pastel color palette, especially the mint and soft pink tones, represents the gentle, comforting nature of the Sumikko Gurashi characters. Rounded corners, minimal harsh edges, and gentle transitions helped me maintain a soothing look that would appeal to both kids and adults.

                <p>
                    The typefaces I chose were <strong>Fredoka</strong> for body text and <strong>Baloo 2</strong> for headings. Both have round shapes that mirror the soft outlines of the characters. I wanted the text to be readable yet still carry a playful energy that complements the visual theme. The layout uses clear sections and padding so the eye can rest between each element, allowing everything to feel structured but never stiff.

                <p>
                    Every design choice — from button styles to image shapes — was made with warmth in mind. The buttons are rounded with pastel hover effects to invite clicks without pressure, and the images are meant to feel “cuddly” through color and softness. Though I originally planned to draw everything myself, time constraints led me to use AI-generated visuals that matched my chosen palette. I made sure these kept a consistent mood with the rest of my site’s aesthetic.

                <p>
                    Overall, my design reflects the charm of Sumikko Gurashi: imperfect but cozy, shy yet welcoming. It’s not flashy or overwhelming — it’s a space meant to make people smile and feel at peace.
