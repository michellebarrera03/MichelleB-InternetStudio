	<h2> Questions</h2>
	<h3>What are the advantages and disadvantages of sketching wireframes over wireframe software?</h3>
	<p>Some advantages are that sketching is quick, flexible, and minimizes distractions, allowing for rapid ideation. ​On the other hand, some disadvantages are that  it lacks interactivity, version control, collaboration, and requires duplication of work when transitioning to digital tools.</p>
	<h3>Write a paragraph on which type of wireframing style would work best with your project and why.</h3>
	<p>So for a digital sticker archive website, a low-to-mid fidelity wireframing style would work best initially, focusing on structure, content organization , and user flow. ​ This style allows you to map out key features like search functionality, category filters, and sticker previews without getting bogged down in visual details. As the project progresses, transitioning to highfidelity wirefrrames with interactive elements would be beneficial to showcase how users can interact with the archive, such as zooming in on stiickers, saving favorites, or navigating through collections. This approach ensures a balance between rapid iteration and detailed design, aligning with the needs of both developers and users. </p>
